Processing Game
==================

This untitled game was built using Processing and Java for a Creative Programming art class. It takes a lot of the things I learned and built in <a href = https://github.com/NamelessPerson/Intro-to-Game-Dev>Intro to Game Developement> and applies them. Game is a simple platformer with one cool mechanic where swinging lights will hide/show keys.
